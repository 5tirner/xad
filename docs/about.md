# About

## History

In 2010, [Xcelerit](https://www.xcelerit.com) started working on AAD,
building on early works of Professor Mike Giles and Professor Paul Glasserman
for efficiently calculating greeks in quantitative finance with AAD.
Xcelerit's closed-source tool QuantAD was first released in 2014,
targeting the quantitative finance industry.
The tool evolved over the years with more features and better performance.
In July 2022, Xcelerit generalised it so it can be used in other industries and published it as an open-source tool,
rebranded as XAD 1.0.0.

## Logo and Name
